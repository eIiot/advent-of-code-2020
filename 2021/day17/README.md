## Day 17

This one was fun to simulate, but not that challenging after I figured out the trick. I also wrote a way to visualize it (see [part1-render.txt](./out/part1-render.txt)), which was probably more challenging than the actual simulation.

I also decided to brute-foce part 2. I can probably optimize it more just by reducing the limits... if I want to.

### Part 1 Output

```txt
[23.62ms] launches
```

### Part 2 Output

```txt
[40.83s] launches
Number of options: 3186
```
