# Advent of Code

## What's the Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language.

## Can I use this?

Yes, although most of it is badly written. AoC is a learning experience.

## Why?

Because it's fun, and because it's a great way to learn a new language (like rust).

## Why so many languages?

Because AOC is a great way to learn skills in a new language

## Rules (for myself)

- No Copilot
- No npm packages (for ts)

## Where is the Rust Generator From?

It's from [this](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust) amazing template, created by @fspoettel.
