# Advent of Code

## What's the Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language.

## Can I use this?

Yes, although it's badly written

## Why?

Because it's fun :)

## Why so many languages?

Because AOC is a great way to learn skills in a new language

## Why use `debugger;` at the end of every file?

It allows VSCode to save the variables in the debugger instead of exiting.

## Rules (for myself)

- No Copilot
- No npm packages
